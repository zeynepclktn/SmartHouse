# Smart House 

The materials used in this project are the basic components for creating a home automation system. Essential components like Arduino R3 and breadboard are used for circuit creation and control, while the Bluetooth module enables communication with mobile devices. Motion detection sensors and servo motors are used to detect movements in the house and control windows and doors, while soil and moisture sensors are used to manage garden irrigation. Temperature sensors and fans are used to control the temperature of the house and provide cooling in undesirable temperatures. With these components coming together, users can remotely control their homes, save energy, and enhance security.

### Descriptions of Used Materials

Arduino Uno R3: Its function is to communicate with LEDs and other Arduino equipment through software and provide power supply.

Breadboard: Its function is to receive energy from the cables and transmit it to peripheral equipment such as sensors, motors, and LEDs with a predetermined voltage value.

Bluetooth Module: Its function is to facilitate communication between a mobile device and Arduino by transmitting commands from the mobile device to Arduino.

Temperature Sensor: Its function is to relay the current temperature inside the house to the user.

Motion Detection Sensor: Its function is to alert the user in case of any movement inside the house.

Servo Motor: It provides 180-degree rotation to open doors and windows.
Passive Buzzer: It serves as an alarm when motion is detected.

Soil and Moisture Sensor: It measures the soil moisture.

FAN: It cools the house when the temperature exceeds the set value.

Liquid Crystal Display (LCD): It displays the soil moisture value and the house temperature to the user.

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor): It ensures the garden lighting works at night.

LEDs: They provide lighting for the house and garden.

Male-Female Jumper Wires, Male-Male Jumper Wires: They are used to connect peripheral equipment such as sensors and motors.
